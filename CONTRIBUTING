# Contributing to etools Library

## How to Contribute

The contribution process follows the standard GitHub workflow.
### 1. Reporting a Bug

Check the [Issues]() to see if the bug has already been reported.

If not, open a new issue. Please provide a clear and concise description, including:

- A brief summary of the bug.

- The steps to reproduce the behavior.

- The expected behavior.

- The hardware and software versions (e.g., ESP32, Arduino Core v2.0.14).

### 2. Suggesting an Improvement or New Feature

Open a new issue in the [Issues]() section.

Clearly describe the feature you would like to see, explaining its purpose and why you believe it would be a valuable addition to the library.

### 3. Submitting Code

The workflow is as follows:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes. Please use a descriptive name (e.g., fix/bug-description or feat/new-feature-name).
4. Make your changes. Adhere to the existing coding style and C++17 standard. Write clean, well-commented code.
5. Test your changes. Ensure your changes do not introduce new bugs and that all existing functionality remains intact.
6. Update documentation. If your changes affect the public API or add a new feature, please update the relevant documentation.
7. Commit your changes. Write a clear, descriptive commit message.
Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main branch of the original repository.

I will review all pull requests and work with you to get your changes merged.
